# Report

netbox reports for Vmware VMs.


## Install

just do a pip install pynetbox first, and create an api token for your user and sub that in

### Notes
the vm[:64] is me truncating the name to 64 characters because that is max netbox can store
so some of those super long names have to be shortened when searching netbox
